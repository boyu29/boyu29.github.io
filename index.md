### ABOUT
***

My name is Boyu(博宇) Chen(陈). I am a second year master student in ECE department at [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) and my academic track now is intelligent systems & robotics control. Before this I obtained my bachelor degree of engineering in electrical engineering from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn).

I have experiences in full-stack development, machine learning, natual language processing. I am now actively **seeking full-time jobs in software development**. For more information, may you refer to my [resume](/Boyu_Chen_CV.pdf).

Software & Machine Learning Intern, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, Jul. 2020 - Dec. 2020

- Realized automatic composition function integrating separate paragraph outputs using a voice conversion engine into entireties conforming to natural languages’ semantics via **python-flask**
- Utilized **Bags of Words** embedded method to vectorize text data; applied semantic analysis using **Logistic Regression** to network state recognition(**90%** accuracy)
- Calculated similarity matrix of text, achieved text abstraction using **TextRank**(graphic structured)

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
***

#### Purdue University

Research Assistant, Advisor: [Meng Cui](https://mengcuilab.github.io), West Lafayette, IN, US, Jul. 2019 - Sep. 2019

- **Deep Fog Imaging:** Built a spatiotemporally-gated detection system to filter out deep fog(scattering back- ground and shot noise); yielded high resolution and contrast image; published the results on Optics Express
- **Real-time Image Stabilization:** Generated triangle signals in vertical directions to control laser scanning
speed; collected data gravity core as feedback for real-time image motion tracking and correction(200Hz)
